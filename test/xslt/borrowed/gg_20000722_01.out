These would include\ncopyright management systems to protect the right to read anonymously,\npermitting individuals to pay with untraceable digital cash; prohibiting\nthe collection and disclosure of identifying information without the\nreader's knowledge, or using digital certificates to create psudonymous\ndownloading.\n\nTo Rosen, author of Gaze, cyberspace is posing a greater menace to\nprivacy by the day. He details the l998 forced resignation of Harvard\nDivinity School dean Ronald F. Thiemann, who downloaded pornography onto\nhis university-owned home computer. A Harvard technician installing a\ncomputer with more memory at the dean's residence was transferring files\nfrom the old computer to the new one and noticed thousands of\npornographic pictures. Although none of the pictures appeared to involve\nminors, the technician told his supervisor. University administrators\nasked the dean to step down.\n\nHarvard justified its decision by claiming that Divinity School rules\nprohibited personal use of university computers in any way that clashed\nwith its educational mission. But the dean was using his computer at\nhome, not work. And no student or colleague suggested he had improperly\nbehaved in any way as head of the Divinity School. His work was never\nquestioned. It's ludicrous to suggest that the school would have fired\nhim if he'd been downloading sports scores or bidding for furniture on\neBay. But although he'd committed no crime and performed well in his\njob, he was forced out in disgrace, while his intimate communications\nwere discussed in public.\n\n\nShould free citizens in a democratic society have to spend money for\n"nyms" to preserve the privacy they ought to be -- and once were --\naccorded in law? How many millions of computer users will even know of\nthis new technology, or have the money to use it?  Rosen's implication\nis that even if software caused the problem, then software will clean\nup.\n\nHis assurances seem a bit "gee-whiz." But to ignore them cynically on\nthat basis, or to trust them completely, ignores the history of\ntechnology. What people can create, others can and will undo. Technology\nthat can be used will be used. In an otherwise powerful book, he also\nglosses over powerful incentives for eliminating privacy in cyberspace.\nFirst, the megacorporations dominating media, business and government\nwill continue to aggressively explore ways of tracking potential\ncustomers as Net use grows. Secondly, law enforcement agencies like the\nFBI have been fighting for decades for the right to deploy tracking\nprograms like "Carnivore" (see part one) and are hardly likely to back\noff.\n\n  \n<BR>\n      <BR>\n    </DIV>\n    <DIV ALIGN="JUSTIFY">\n     This is an example of a description:\n     Can pseudonymous downloading, "snoop-proof" e-mail, digital pseuds called\n     "nyms," PDA-like machines, allegedly untraceable digi-cash and other\n     changes in software and the architecture of cyberspace, restore some\n     privacy and restore the idea of the "Inviolate Personality?"
